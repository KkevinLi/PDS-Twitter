# Twitter 2.0

Twitter 2.0 is a remake of Twitter using the Python programmign language and the Flask Framework.
It will be a multi-stage project and this is only the frontend part 1.
Database is a directory used for storing all the users info and tweets.
There are a bunch of files in the Database directory that can be removed for a fresh start. 
Register a new user to begin. Else   Email: s@g   password: "a" is already useable for testing
After Flask is installed, the program can be run using webInterface.py. 
	(Debug Mode is left on intentionally and secret key is not random for easier testing)

# Twitter 2.0 Features

		- Logging and Registering: For each user create a txt with the user's Name, email and password		
		- Logout : All session variables are cleared upon visiting this page.
		- Follow : Signed in users (verified with a session['authenticated'] ) are able to follow other
					users by entering their email.
		- Followers : By going to the '/followers' page, signed in users will be able to see the people they
						are being followed by and who they follow
		- PostTweet : This functionality is implemented on the home page and is visible only to users signed in. 
						All friends will have a copy of this message stored in a recentTweet txt file

# List of Funtions:
		
		- Header: Contains the navbar, bootstrap links, and the flash message
		
		- Follow: Loads a simple form input to follow another user. Used together with 
					the function friend() which checks if the user exists before adding 
					the email to the follow text file.
					
		- Home : Includes a form input for textarea used as a tweet with a maximum 
				length of 100 characters. Utilizes bootstraps columns to display recent messages from people you follow
				For my implementation, if a user has no followers only his own tweets will show. 
				Else the tweets his followers make will be displayed instead.
				
		- writeToFile(email,password,name): The purpose of this function is to store a new users 
											information into a txt file to use for verification.
		- friendRequest(friendEmail) : 	A function that verifies and adds the email you wish to follow			
										into your own follow txt file and adds the user to the friends 
										followers txt file.
		- verifyUser(email, password = None): 	Using two parameters to make this function reusable so that	
												I am able to check if an email for register already exists
												and login is able to check if the entered credentials is correct.
		- writeTweetAll(tweet) : Takes in a string entered in the homepage and writes that to every follower's 
								 text file. The message is also written to the user's tweet file.
		
		- ListFriends : Using the listFollowers() function, this rendered page will show both followers 
						and those you follow
		- logreg : Using the jinja template we are able to use the same page for both login and 
					register. Uses: VerifyUser and writeToFile functions.
					
		- myTweets: HTML page that flushes all the data found in usersTweet
		
		- Tweeting : Embedded into the home page and uses the writeTweetAll which creates two new files	
					 one for your own tweets and one which contain tweets from all friends
					 
#Database Files:
	Consists of a series of text files created by functions to keep track of users information
	
		Sample File:
		
		- kevin@gmail.com   : a file named in this manner  x@y will be the users email,name and password
		- kevin@gmail.comfollowing : contain lines of user emails 
		- kevin@gmail.comfollowers : Similar to the following txt file, this one only shows the people you follow
		- kevin@gmail.comTweets : a text file containing ONLY the users tweets
		- kevin@gmail.comFriendTweet : contains tweets from all your friends, but does not have timing control ATM
